ME: 
(It’s my second week at Amazon academy.)
(My teachers have been telling me to join a club, but I'm not really interested in anything...)
(...huh, what’s this?)
(The nature club?)
“This is the Nature club, come save the planet with us!!!!”
Well, I have to join some kind of club. So I'll just join this one.  (game continues)

Janice Jaguar: Welcome to the nature club!!! We’re so happy you are here!!!

Janice Jaguar : So to start the year off, we'll do some activities! This year's theme is saving the rainforest. 
How about we plant trees and host a fundraiser?
We'll start with planting trees!
(Everyone agrees)

Hey new guy, glad to hear you want to help me plant trees!
Its really important that we work to replant the rainforst,  {cue sadface}
because more than 200,000 acres of rainforest is destroyed each day. 
[cue happy face]
But with enough people committed to the cause, we can save the rainforests!

Olivia otter: so, to plant trees, you want to click F or J when the tree aligns with the yellow circle! 
Easy enough right?

Ready? Begin!      { olivia otter goes away}
